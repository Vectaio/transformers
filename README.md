# transformers
Lightweight zero-dependency transformation matrix utilities

## Why
Perform transformation matrix calculation in a 2D plane. Use this library to:
- create a transformation matrix and manipulate it via **translation**, **rotation**, **scale**, **shear**, **skew** 
- Parse a transformation in string format
- Obtain a point after applying transformation

## Install
```javascript
npm install transformers
```
